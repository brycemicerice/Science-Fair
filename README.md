# Science-Fair
Hello, this is my code that I have created built for Science Fair. 

Within the file named "survey_item_distributions-Copy2.ipynb," the specific design methods I describe in my slideshow PDF all begin with "Bryce Li," although I did work on other parts of the code as well to support the rescoring.

The entire ML3 document is where I trained, tuned, and tested my M5P model.
